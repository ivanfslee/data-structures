//Algorithms and Problem Solving Patterns

//What is an algorithm?
    //a process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task
    //everything in programming involves some kind of algorithm
    //it is the foundation for being a successful problem solver and developer

//Devise a plan to solve algorithms
    //How do you improve?
        //1. Devise a plan for solving problems
        //2. Master common problem solving patterns 

    //IOCE - input/output/constraints/edge cases
    // Step 1 - Understand the problem
    // Step 2 - Explore concrete examples
    // Step 3 - Break it down
    // Step 4 - Solve/simplify
    // Step 5 - Look back and refactor 


//Compare and contrast problem solving patterns 
    //frequency counters
    //two pointer problems
    //divide and conquer
