//Algo Expert Notes on Strings
    //strings are typically known as a data type
    //strings also can behave like a data structure
        //that we manipulate that has its own time and space complexity

    //Strings are implemented differently depending on the programming language being used
        //recall - string is stored in memory as an array of integers
        //each integer corresponds to a character mapped by a character encoding standard - e.g. ascii
        //'A' maps to 65
        //'B' maps to 66
        //'a' maps to 97
        //ASCII standard has fewer than 256
