//Introduction to Sorting Algorithms 

//Elementary Sorting Algorithms 

//What is sorting?
    //Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection (e.g. an array) 
    //so that the items are in some kind of order

    //e.g. sorting numbers from smallest to largest
    //sort names alphabetically
    //sort movies based based on release year 
    //sort movies based on revenue 

//Why learn sorting?
    //sorting is an incredibly common task - good to know how it works
    //there are many different ways to sort things
    //and different techniqes have their own advantages and disadvantages 

    //it also depends on our data
        //on totally random data insertion sort is slow
        //but on nearly sorted data, insertion sort is fast

//Elementary Sorting Algorithms 
    //less commonly used because they are less performant or are only good in certain situations 
    //bubble sort
    //selection sort
    //insertion sort
