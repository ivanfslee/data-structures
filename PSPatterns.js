//Frequency Counters Pattery
    //This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
    //This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays/strings
    //Useful if you have multiple inputs and need to compare/contrast them
    //Typically is O(N) time (naive solution of nested for loops is O(N^2) time)
    //someArray.indexOf(someArray[i]);  //indexOf method is O(N) time 

//Multiple Pointers Pattern

// Sliding Window Pattern

//Divide and Conquer
