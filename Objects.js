//When to use objects
    //When you don't need order
    //when you need fast access/insertion/removal

//Big O of Obj
    //Insertion O(1)
    //Removal O(1)
    //Searching O(N) - search if a particular value exists in obj
    //Access O(1)
    //When you don't need any ordering, objects are a good choice 

//Hash table/hash map section talks about how/why they are constant time operations 

//Big O of Obj Methods
    //Object.keys()  O(N) - goes through each key-value pair and adds key to an array 
    //Object.values()  O(N) - goes through each key-value pair and adds value to an array 
    //Object.entries() O(N) - goes through each key-value pair and adds key and value to an array 
    //hasOwnProperty  O(1) - similar to Accessing stuff in obj - this checks if obj has a particular key
