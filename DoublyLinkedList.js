//Construct a doubly linked list
//Compare and contrast Doubly and Singly Linked Lists
//Implement basic operations on a doubly linked list 
    //push
    //pop
    //shift
    //unshift
    //insert
    //get
    //set


//Doubly Linked List 
    //Almost identical to Singly Linked List
    //Except every node has another pointer
    //to the previous node

    //head points to null and next node
    //tail points to previous node and null 

    //Removing last node is alot easier with Doubly Linked Lists
    //You can go to the tail and then go to the previous node to remove the tail
    //With Singly Linked List, to remove last node, you have to go through the whole list
    //and get to the second to the last element, in order to remove the tail.
