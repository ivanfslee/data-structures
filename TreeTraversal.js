//Given a tree (any tree) - BST, etc
//How to visit every node one time?
//Will make use of recursion heavily 

//Two main ways to traverse a tree
    //Breadth-first Search - going horizontally across each node level
    //Depth-first Search
        //DFS - PreOrder    
        //DFS - InOrder
        //DFS - PostOrder

//DFS vs BFS - Do we prioritize visiting all nodes on same level before we move down ?
//or do we want to work in a more vertical way with DFS?

//Our approach on BFS vs DFS depends a lot on how tree is structured (e.g. 100+ children per node) and how it branches and how the data is distributed
