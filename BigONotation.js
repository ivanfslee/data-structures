//What is the need for Big O notation?
    //A way to compare different implementations of code 
    //You can use it discuss tradeoffs between different approaches (serves as an analytical tool)
    //When your code slows down or crashes, you can pinpoint inefficiences and bottlenecks in your applications

    //We don't use time that algo takes-
        //Different machines will record different times
        //Same machine will record different times
        //For particularly fast algos, speed measurements may not be precise enough

//What is Big O Notation?
    //Count the number of simple operations the computer performs 
    //Allows us to talk formally about how runtime of an algo grows as input grows

//Simplify Big O Expressions

//Define 'time complexity' and 'space complexity'

//Evaluate time and space complexity of different algorithms using Big O notation

//What a logarithm is

//Algo Expert - Complexity Analysis
    //Time Complexity & Space Complexity
        //Time Complexity 
            //Measure of how fast an algo runs
        //Space Complexity
            //Measure of how much memory/space an algo takes up 

    // One Problem - Multiple Solutions - How do you compare them? 
        //What makes one solution better than another solution?
            //Whether or not solution has a better time and/or space complexity
            //S1 - solution 1
            //S2 - solution 2
            //S3 - solution 3

        //What if one solution has better time, but another solution has better space?
            //Then that would depend on the use case of the algorithm
            //Which is more important in how the alforithm is used? 
            //Is time more important? 
            //Or is space more important?

    //What data structure best allows you to solve problem with best time and space complexity

    //Memory 
        //As a canvas that is bounded (limited number of slots)
        //Slots in memory - space complexity 
        //Open memory slots that are consecutive 
        //Memory is made up of bits (series of 0's and 1's)
        //One bit - (0 or 1) - stands for 'Binary Digit'
            //Binary Number System aka Base 2 Number System - 0000 0001 - 8 bit representation for number 1 
            //Each column represents power of 2 number.  
            //Right most column 2^0 -> 1
            //Column next to it 2^1 -> 2
            //Column next to it 2^2 -> 4
        //One memory slot can store 8 bits aka 1 byte
