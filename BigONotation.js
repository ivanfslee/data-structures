//What is the need for Big O notation?
    //A way to compare different implementations of code 
    //You can use it discuss tradeoffs between different approaches (serves as an analytical tool)
    //When your code slows down or crashes, you can pinpoint inefficiences and bottlenecks in your applications
//What is Big O Notation?

//Simplify Big O Expressions

//Define 'time complexity' and 'space complexity'

//Evaluate time and space complexity of different algorithms using Big O notation

//What a logarithm is
