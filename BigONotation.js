//What is the need for Big O notation?
    //A way to compare different implementations of code 
    //You can use it discuss tradeoffs between different approaches (serves as an analytical tool)
    //When your code slows down or crashes, you can pinpoint inefficiences and bottlenecks in your applications

    //We don't use time that algo takes-
        //Different machines will record different times
        //Same machine will record different times
        //For particularly fast algos, speed measurements may not be precise enough

//What is Big O Notation?
    //Count the number of simple operations the computer performs 
    //Allows us to talk formally about how runtime of an algo grows as input grows

//Simplify Big O Expressions

//Define 'time complexity' and 'space complexity'

//Evaluate time and space complexity of different algorithms using Big O notation

//What a logarithm is

    //Time Complexity & Space Complexity
        //Time Complexity 
            //Measure of how fast an algo runs
        //Space Complexity
            //Measure of how much memory/space an algo takes up 

    // One Problem - Multiple Solutions - How do you compare them? 
        //What makes one solution better than another solution?
            //Whether or not solution has a better time and/or space complexity
            //S1 - solution 1
            //S2 - solution 2
            //S3 - solution 3

        //What if one solution has better time, but another solution has better space?
            //Then that would depend on the use case of the algorithm
            //Which is more important in how the alforithm is used? 
            //Is time more important? 
            //Or is space more important?
