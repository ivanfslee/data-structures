    //Why study algorithms?
    //Uses of Algorithms
        //Routing and communication networks piggyback on classical shortest path algorithms
        //Public key cryptography
        //Database indices rely on balanced search tree data structures
        //Computational biology uses dynamic programming algorithms to measure genome similarity
    //Algorithms - play a key role in modern technological innovation
        //Performance gains due to algorithms exceeded the dramatic performance gains due to increased processor speeds 
    
    //Video 1 - 2
    //Integer Multiplication 
    //Transform an input - 2 numbers, into an output, their product 

    //IOCE - input/output/constraints/edge cases

    //Pattern for the course
        //1. Define a computational problem
        //2. Say what input is, say what output is 
        //3. Give a solution, giving an algorithm that transforms the input to the output
