// Tree definition - data structure consisting of nodes in a PARENT / CHILD relationship 
// Siblings on the same level cannot connect to each other in a tree (that would instead be called a graph)
// only one root (cannot have more than one root node)
//Root - top node in a tree
//Child - 
//Parent - 
//Siblings - nodes with the same parent
//Leaf - node with no children
//Edge - connection between one node and another

// Root node branches to child nodes 
// Most values stored are numbers / strings but you can store arrays/obj/ etc in the nodes of the tree

// Tree vs List
// Lists - linear | Trees - nonlinear 
// You can think of a Singly Linked List as a special case of a tree (a single branch of a tree)

// Tree vs binary tree vs binary search tree
// We'll focus on Binary search tree
